RSpace is a collaborative research data management platform that interoperates with many tools, services and digital infrastructure researchers and their research organizations already use. It is designed to enable frictionless workflows for the creation and management of FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) data across the entire research cycle when researchers plan their research, record experimental data, keep track of physical samples, report on their work and share it with their communities.

# üöß Construction ahead!
Thank you for your interest in the RSpace open-source project! We're excited to have you here!
Releasing RSpace as an open-source project in June 2024 has been huge step for us at Research Space and we likely won't have everything as polished as we'd like it to be in the beginning. Please bear with us as we're taking one step at a time to build an inclusive and efficient contributor experience. If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas how we can improve, don't hesitate to reach out to us üôè.
