RSpace is a collaborative research data management platform that interoperates with many tools, services and digital infrastructure researchers and their research organizations already use. It is designed to enable frictionless workflows for the creation and management of FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) data across the entire research cycle when researchers plan their research, record experimental data, keep track of physical samples, report on their work and share it with their communities.
